guiqwt: Python tools for curve and image plotting
=================================================

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlotPyStack/guiqwt/master/doc/images/panorama.png

The guiqwt library is part of the `PlotPyStack`_ project, providing a set of
tools for creating GUIs for scientific/technical applications with Python,
Qt and SciPy/NumPy.

See `documentation`_ for more details on the library and `changelog`_ for
recent history of changes.

Overview
--------

Based on `PythonQwt`_ (a pure Python/PyQt reimplementation of the curve
plotting Qwt C++ library, included in guiqwt base source code) and on the
scientific modules NumPy and SciPy, ``guiqwt`` is a Python library providing
efficient 2D data-plotting features (curve/image visualization and related
tools) for interactive computing and signal/image processing application
development. It is based on Qt graphical user interfaces library, and
currently supports both ``PyQt5`` and ``PySide2``.

Extension to `PythonQwt`_:

* set of tools for curve and image plotting
* GUI-based application development helpers

.. _PythonQwt: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PythonQwt
